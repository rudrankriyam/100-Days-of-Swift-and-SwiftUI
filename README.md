## Introduction to Swift
"Swift is a fantastic way to write software, whether it’s for phones, desktops, servers, or anything else that runs code. 

It’s a safe, fast, and interactive programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from the wider Apple engineering culture and the diverse contributions from its open-source community. 

The compiler is optimized for performance and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either."

## Introduction to SwiftUI
"SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. 

Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs. With a declarative Swift syntax that’s easy to read and natural to write, SwiftUI works seamlessly with new Xcode design tools to keep your code and design perfectly in sync.

Automatic support for Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, localization, and accessibility means your first line of SwiftUI code is already the most powerful UI code you’ve ever written."

## Challenge
I will create modified and improvised projects taking inspiration on design from dribbble.com on top of the [Hacking with Swift's 100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) and [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) projects. I hope to ship at least 5 projects on the App Store.
